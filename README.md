# KEspectrum-SWOT
## About 
The aim of this repository is to share submesoscale-permitting (or higher resolution) simulations that allow to analyse the seasonal variability of the geostrophic kinetic energy (KE) spectrum in different ocean regions and to compare it with the SWOT satellite altimetry dataset.

## Motivation
Satellite altimetry launches during the last two decades marked a significant advance for oceanographic science through sea level observations in a spatial range from 100 km to over 5,000 km. The geostrophic velocities estimated from SSH allowed  us to describe the KE contained in the mesoscale.  To describe the spatial and temporal variability of KE in the ocean, KE spectra have been extensively employed.  Depending of the processes that drive the dynamics, the KE spectrum slope varies (Klein et al,, (2008)). In situ observations, satellite data, and numerical ocean models show the presence of a significant temporal and regional variability in the distribution of KE (e.g., Callies et al,, (2016), Klein et al,, (2008), Rocha et al., (2016)). 

Recent studies have shown that submesoscale currents can distribute the KE between spatial scales by re-energizing (e.g., Klein et al., 2008, Qiu et al., 2016, Schubert et al., 2020,2023),or removing mesoscale energy (e.g, Capet et al., 2008, Molemaker et al,, 2010). In addition, it has been mentioned that submesoscale processes have significant seasonal variability, with winter being the more active season (e.g., Callies et al., 2016, Schubert et al., 2020). These suggestions have been proposed using in situ observation and numerical simulation, but not with satellite altimetry due to the resolution limitation
However, a new generation of SWOT altimetry satellites has been launched in 2021. SWOT has a resolution that includes part of the submesoscale dynamics, and 18 months of data are currently available. This dataset provides the opportunity to describe the temporal and spatial variability of the geostrophic KE spectrum at a scale not previously described by satellite altimetry.

The objective of this study is to describe the seasonal variability KE spectrum from SWOT and compare with submesoscale permitting/resolving simulation over several oceanic regions. To start, the following regions are proposed for the Gulf Stream, Aguhlas Current and Kuroshio Current (California Current, South Pacific (?)).
