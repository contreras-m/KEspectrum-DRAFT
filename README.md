# KEspectrum-SWOT
## About 
The new generation of satellite altimetry SWOT offers the opportunity to describe the KE spectrum at smallest scale that previous altimetry data can not represent.described by submesoscale permitting simulations. This repo aims to share submesoscale simulations that allow analysis of submesoscale processes around the global ocean and compare the seasonal variability of the SWOT KE spectrum. 

## Motivation
Submesoscale processes have an important role in  energy budget over the ocean. Recent studies have been shown that submesoscale currents can distribute the KE between spatial scales. On one hand, the ageostrophy currents generated by these processes can interact with geostrophy currents, transferring KE to small cascade (REF). On the other hand, submesoscale motions may also contribute to mesoscale re-energization, e.g., through absorption of mixed layer eddies (MLEs) (Qiu et al., 2014; Schubert et al., 2020, 2023).  Previous studies mentioned that submesoscale processes have a significant seasonal variability, being winter the more active season.

To describe the spatial and temporal variability of KE in the ocean, KE spectra have been extensively employed.  Depending of the processes that drive the dynamics, the KE spectrum slope varies (REF). In situ observations, satellite data, and numerical ocean models show the presence of a significant temporal and regional variability in the distribution of KE. 

KE spectral from satellite altimetry do not  reproduces submesoscale scales. At mesoscale, satellite altimetry show discrepancy with submesoscale permitting resolutions models (REF). For example, it has been observed that AVISO data miss a substantial part of the mesoscale eddy energy, which extends to a lower scale than that expected from geostrophic turbulence. The excess energy appears to be associated with underestimated energy at submesoscale, in particular by absorption of mixed layer eddies (MLEs), as mentioned previosly.

The new generation of satellite altimetry SWOT has a resolution that allow describe the submesoscale variability, which gives us the opportunity to verify the hypotheses raised from high-resolution simulations.

The objective of this study is describe the KE spectrum from SWOT and compare with submesoscale permitting/resolving simulation at several oceanic regions. Due to geostrophy currents is provieded from SWOT, we expect evaluate mostly the role of submesoscale on the re-energization in mesoscale and its seasonal variability.
