# KEspectrum-SWOT
## About 
The new generation of satellite altimetry SWOT offers the opportunity to verify the KE distribution described by the submesoscale permitting simulation. This repo aims to share simulations that allow analysis of submesoscale processes around the global ocean and compare the seasonal variability of the SWOT KE spectrum.

## Motivation
Submesoscale processes have an important role in  energy budget over the ocean. Recent studies have been shown that submesoscale currents can distribute the KE between spatial scales. On one hand, the ageostrophy currents generated by these processes can interact with geostrophy currents, transferring KE to small cascade. On the other hand, submesoscale motions may also contribute to mesoscale re-energization, e.g., through absorption of mixed layer ed- dies (MLEs) (Qiu et al., 2014; Schubert et al., 2020).--

To describe the spatial and temporal variability of KE in the ocean, KE spectra have been extensively employed. In situ observations, satellite data, and numerical ocean models show the presence of a significant temporal and regional variability in the distribution of KE.

KE spectral from satellite altimetry do not  reproduces submesoscale scales. At mesoscale, satellite altimetry show discrepancy with submesoscale permitting resolutions models (REF)

The objective is check previous studies about the KE distribution
