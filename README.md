# KEspectrum-SWOT
## About 
The new generation of satellite altimetry SWOT offers the opportunity to verify the KE distribution described by the submesoscale permit simulation. This report aims to share simulations that allow analysis of submesoscale processes around the global ocean and compare the seasonal variability of the SWOT KE spectrum.

## Motivation
Submesoscale processes have an important role in  energy budget over the ocean. Recent studies have been shown  that submesoscale currents can distribute the KE at difference scale, i.e, re-energize the mesoscale or dissipate KE.

To describe the spatial and temporal variability of KE in the ocean, KE spectra have been extensively employed. In situ observations, satellite data, and numerical ocean models show the presence of a significant temporal and regional variability in the distribution of KE.

Previous studies show  discrepancies between satellite altimetry and submesoscale permitting resolutions models. 

The objective is check previous studies about the KE distribution
